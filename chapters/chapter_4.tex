\chapter{A white matter lesion-filling approach to improve brain tissue volume measurements.}

\label{chapter:chapter_4}

In this chapter, we propose a new technique to fill WM lesions before the tissue segmentation. The proposed approach is evaluated in both 1.5T and 3T data. We validate our method comparing its accuracy with other proposed automated lesion filling methods on the same data. Furthermore, the proposed technique has been released for public use both as a standalone program or as an SPM8/SPM12 library.
