matter lesions}  

\label{chapter:chapter_6}

In this chapter, we propose a novel, automated pipeline for tissue segmentation of MS patient images containing lesions. The accuracy of the method is evaluated using both the challenge MRBrainS13 database\footnote{http://mrbrains13.isi.uu.nl/} and a 3T MS database of MS patient images. We validate the accuracy of the proposed method with other state-of-the-art techniques. A public version of this method has been released for public use.  The proposed pipeline has been described in detail in the next paper and submitted to the Medical Imaging Journal:
