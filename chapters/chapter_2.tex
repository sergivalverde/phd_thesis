\label{chapter:chapter_2}

In this chapter, we perform a quantitative evaluation of the accuracy of 10 automated brain tissue segmentation methods. Methods are compared based using the Internet Brain Segmentation Repository (IBSR) databases IBSR20 and IBSR18 \footnote{https://www.nitrc.org/projects/ibsr/}. The performance of the methods is evaluated by ranking their accuracy based on the significant differences with respect the rest of methods. This proposed evaluation has been published in the following paper:
