methods}  
\label{chapter:chapter_3}
In this chapter, we present a study of the impact of MS white matter lesions on the brain tissue measurements of six well-known segmentation techniques. These include straightforward techniques such as Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and fuzzy C-means (FCM) as well as more advanced techniques like the Fuzzy And Noise Tolerant Adaptive Segmentation Method (FANTASM), FMRIB's Automated Segmentation Tool (FAST), and Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) with versions SPM5 and SPM8. This proposed evaluation has been published in the following paper:
