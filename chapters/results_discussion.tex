MRI tissue segmentation techniques are being used increasingly as standard tools to assess brain tissue volume. However, automated tissue segmentation is still a challenging task in MS, due to the tissue abnormalities found in MS patient images such as WM lesions that are known to reduce the accuracy of tissue segmentation methods. When expert manual annotations of WM lesions are available, lesion filling has shown to be an effective method to reduce the effects of those lesions on tissue segmentation. However, manual annotations are time-consuming and prone to variability among experts, which in combination with the need to analyze focal MS lesions quantitatively in individual and temporal studies, has led to the development of a wide number of automated lesion segmentation of MS lesions. Therefore, a solid understanding of the effects of MS lesions on automated pipelines that concatenate processes such as lesion segmentation, lesion filling and tissue segmentation is important. 

As stated in section \ref{sec:objectives}, each of these processes covers a part of the necessary knowledge needed to tackle the problem of automated brain tissue segmentation of images containing lesions. This chapter provides a comprehensive discussion of the main results shown in previous chapters, analyzing each of these necessary processes for the development of a fully automated tissue segmentation method for MS images.

\section{Effect of WM lesions on tissue segmentation}

A wide number of automated tissue segmentation methods have been proposed in the literature so far. In Chapter \ref{chapter:chapter_2}, we evaluated the accuracy of ten approaches using the two available public databases of healthy subjects, IBSR18 and IBSR20. With the aim of including a wide set of different segmentation approaches and available tools, the analysis included well-known intensity based algorithms such as ANN, FCM, and KNN, as well as available public toolboxes such as FAST, SPM5, SPM8, PVC, GAMIXTURE, SVPASEG, and FANTASM. Results were presented before and after correcting the CSF masks, as we saw that available annotations ignored sulcal CSF tissue in the original masks. When sulcal CSF was corrected, the SVPASEG, SPM8 and FAST yielded the highest accuracy with both databases.  However, most of the methods were variant to changes in acquisition sequences, intensity inhomogeneities and special attributes of the two databases,  which highlighted the fact that the brain tissue segmentation problem was still open, because there was not a single method that achieved a significantly higher accuracy with all tissues. 

Afterwards, six of these methods (ANN, FCM, FANTASM, FAST, SPM5 and SPM8) were evaluated on MS data from different hospital centers and scanners in order to analyze the extent to which tissue volume estimations were affected by changes in the WM lesion volume and intensity. Our results showed that the SPM8 had the lowest differences in total volume, while the FANTASM and again, the SPM8 were the methods where the incidence of WM lesions was the lowest on normal-appearing tissue. In general, the differences in tissue volume were lower for methods combining morphological prior information, namely the SPM5 and SPM8, or spatial constraints, like the FANTASM and FAST. In contrast, these differences were higher on simpler intensity based algorithms such as FCM and ANN, that lacked spatial correction. This fact and the higher performance on healthy data of former methods, stressed the necessity of adding morphological prior information and/or spatial constraints to the automated brain tissue segmentation, not only to overcome inherent MRI artifacts but also as an important component to deal with WM lesions.

The main factor in the differences in tissue volume across the methods was caused by lesion volume. Furthermore, WM lesion voxels tended to be classified as GM in images where the variation between the lesion signal intensity and the mean signal intensity of normal-appearing WM was higher, which indicates a direct relationship between the differences in the brain tissue volume and the changes in the lesion load and WM lesion intensity. However, the lesion voxels also had a direct effect on the differences in GM and WM outside the lesion regions. As already mentioned in Chapter \ref{chapter:chapter_3}, these differences are especially important because they highlight the bias introduced by WM lesions on the estimation of tissue volume that is not pathologically affected. Our analysis showed that if lesion voxels were not considered in the computation of the brain volume, methods would still tend to overestimate GM, specially in images with a higher lesion load. The  differences observed in normal-appearing tissue volume were important, because, although lesion voxels could be reassigned to WM after segmentation, if these lesions were present in image segmentation, part of the bias was still present. Furthermore, differences in the total tissue volume may be canceled between the errors produced in the same lesion regions as well as the effect of these voxels on normal-appearing tissue. This fact clearly shows the necessity of processing WM lesions before segmentation.


\section{Effect of lesion filling in tissue segmentation}

Over the last few years, different techniques have been proposed to reduce the bias introduced by WM lesions on the brain tissue volume measurements in MS images, mostly by in-painting WM lesions on T1-w with signal intensities similar to normal-appearing WM.  After reviewing the  available related literature in Chapter \ref{chapter:chapter_4}, we classified the existing methods into groups, those that filled WM lesions using the \textit{local} intensities from the surrounding neighboring lesion voxels, and those that used \textit{global} WM intensities from the whole brain to fill WM lesions. Although all these methods had already been validated separately, we performed a general comparison of all the available techniques in order to analyze their accuracy with the same 1.5T and 3T data and also to investigate their performance with different tissue segmentation techniques such as the FAST and SPM8.

This analysis served as a basis for a new technique to refill WM lesions that was a compromise between \textit{global} and \textit{local} methods. In contrast to other existing techniques, the proposed method filled lesion voxel intensities with random values of a normal distribution generated from the mean WM signal intensity of each two-dimensional slice. Our results showed that when compared to other methods, our approach yielded the lowest deviation in GM and WM volumes with 1.5T and 3T data when the FAST tissue segmentation was used. When the SPM8 tissue segmentation method was used, the performance of our lesion filling method was also very competitive, yielding the lowest differences or similar to those of the best method in GM and WM. In contrast to the rest of the pipelines, differences in tissue volume between the same images filled with our method and afterwards segmented with either the FAST or SPM8 were very low ($<0.1\%$), which indicates that the proposed strategy was equally efficient independently of the tissue segmentation chosen.

The proposed algorithm performed significantly better than local methods on images with higher lesion loads. In contrast to \textit{global} methods, \textit{local} methods may be limited by the range of similar intensities coming from neighboring voxels, which on images with large lesions may introduce a bias on GM and WM tissue distributions by the addition of a considerable number of voxels with similar intensities. Furthermore, the performance of our approach was also better on images with high lesion loads when compared with \textit{local} methods, specially on images with lower resolution such as 1.5T data, most probably because our method estimated the mean global normal-appearing WM intensity for each slice independently, being sensitive enough to reproduce possible changes in the intensities between slices.


\section{Effect of automating lesion segmentation and filling on  tissue segmentation}
\label{sec:label}

As already mentioned earlier, lesion filling has proven to be an effective method to reduce the effects of these lesions on tissue segmentation. However, in all the lesion-filling approaches, including ours, MS lesions have to be known a priori, which requires delineating lesions manually. This is a clear limitation in terms of fully automatizing brain tissue in the presence of MS lesions, which motivated the evaluation of the effect of automated lesion segmentation on tissue segmentation. Although different automated tissue segmentation methods have been proposed, most are based on supervised learning, which requires to explicit training, usually with a large amount of labeled data. Labeled data may be not available, which  pointed up the interest of the community in unsupervised methods that can operate without prior data. As shown in Chapter \ref{chapter:chapter_5}, we compared two fully unsupervised pipelines that combined automated lesion segmentation and filling as a first step to understand the effect of fully processed images on tissue segmentation. 
 
Given the performance shown in our previous studies and its wide use in clinical studies, the SPM8 was used as a reference tissue segmentation method to measure tissue volume on a set of 70 3T images from CIS patients. On these images, available manual expert annotations were employed to refill WM lesions before segmentation using the pipeline's filling method, and were considered as the ground-truth. Afterwards, we evaluated the differences in the GM and WM volumes between the set of filled images using manual annotations and the same images processed using different variations of the SLS and LST toolkits that differed in the level of manual intervention.  Evaluating different pipelines with distinct levels of automation  permitted us to analyze the effect of each of the automated processes involved in the differences in the total and normal-appearing tissue volumes.  

As already stated in Chapter \ref{chapter:chapter_3}, this new analysis showed that the effect of lesions on the total tissue volume was limited due to a canceling effect between the errors produced in the same lesion regions, and the effect of these voxels on normal-appearing tissue. In all the pipelines that incorporated automated lesion segmentation, most of the differences observed in normal-appearing tissue were produced by the effect of false positive lesion voxels that were already segmented and had not been refilled. In contrast, there was no relevant correlation between the number of false positive lesion voxels and the differences observed in normal-appearing GM and WM, which suggested that most of these miss-classified voxels were actually WM before refilling. The relationship between errors in automated lesion and tissue segmentation also suggest the importance of not only continuously reducing the number of missed lesions, but also stressing the necessity of contextual spatial information of lesion regions in order to confine them in the WM and, hence, reduce the effect of miss-classified voxels on the tissue segmentation.

As shown in the results presented in Chapter \ref{chapter:chapter_4}, masking-out lesion voxels before tissue segmentation might not be optimal, as leaving lesion voxels out of the tissue distributions appears to increase the differences in tissue volume with respect to lesion filled images, even if these voxels are re-assigned to WM afterwards. However, although not optimal, masking lesions before segmentation has proven to be a valid alternative to reduce the effects of WM lesions on research and clinical settings, and as a result in recent years, lesion filling techniques have already been applied on research and clinical studies. Regarding this, our results show that at least with the evaluated data, the differences in tissue volume between images where expert lesion masks have been masked-out and the same images where lesions have been automatically segmented and filled, are similar to images with a low lesion load $(<10ml)$. In contrast, from our experiments we observed that differences in tissue volumes tend to increase with the lesion load on masked-out images, while the increase of the error is more moderate in  fully-automated images. However, given the data available and the maximum lesion load considered in our analysis ($<20ml$), these findings should be considered with care. 

In any case, our analysis points out the fact that automated lesion segmentation and filling methods significantly reduced the impact of WM lesions on tissue segmentation, and had a similar performance to the pipelines that required manual expert intervention. These results are relevant and validate that each of these automated processes can be useful not only in terms of time and economic costs, but also as active processes in fully automated tissue segmentation in the presence of WM lesions.

\section{Fully automated tissue segmentation of images containing WM lesions}
\label{sec:label}

Previous sections of this paper have stressed the necessity of dealing with MS lesions before the tissue segmentation, showing several general insights that can be useful for automated tissue segmentation of images containing lesions. The results obtained for the different methods evaluated in Chapter \ref{chapter:chapter_2} and \ref{chapter:chapter_3} have pointed out the superiority of methods that benefited from morphological prior information or spatial constraints in automated brain tissue segmentation. More importantly, the results obtained in Chapter \ref{chapter:chapter_3} have evidenced the effect of WM lesion on tissue segmentation and the necessity of dealing with MS lesions in order to reduce not only the bias produced by the same lesions but also the effect of these lesion voxels on normal-appearing tissue. In this scenario, we have proposed a new lesion filling technique that is very competitive with different databases and tissue segmentation methods, as shown in Chapter \ref{chapter:chapter_4}. Finally, we have shown in Chapter \ref{chapter:chapter_5} that the addition of unsupervised lesion segmentation and filling to already existing tissue segmentation pipelines significantly reduced the error in tissue volume when compared with other pipelines where lesions were segmented as normal tissue. 

Following these insights, we have developed a new, multi-channel method designed to segment brain tissues in MRI images of MS patients. As explained in Chapter \ref{chapter:chapter_6}, this approach makes use of a combination of intensity, anatomical and morphological prior maps to guide the tissue segmentation. Tissue segmentation has been tackled based on a robust partial volume segmentation where WM outliers have been estimated and refilled before segmentation using a multi-channel post-processing algorithm integrating  partial volume segmentation, spatial context, and prior anatomical and morphological atlases. Furthermore, the proposed method takes advantage of new affordable processors, such as GPUs, that reduce up to four times the execution time to register and segment tissue when compared to general purpose CPUs. This property makes this method useful for studies containing a large number of subjects to analyze.   

The proposed method has been quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated using different databases of images containing WM lesions. In order to analyze the extent to which the T1-w and FLAIR modalities intervened in the accuracy obtained, the proposed method was run in all the experiments using only the T1-w or using both the T1-w and FLAIR image sequences. As shown by the results, the proposed technique yielded competitive and consistent results in both general and MS specific databases without parameter tweaking. In the MRBrainS tissue segmentation challenge\footnote{http://mrbrains13.isi.uu.nl/}, our method, combining both T1-w and FLAIR, was the best non-supervised technique in the challenge, being ranked in 7th position out of 31 participant methods. When only the T1-w modality was used, the accuracy of the proposed method was still clearly superior to general purpose methods such as FAST (ranked 21th) and SPM12 (best ranked 17th), even as they used both image modalities. With MS data, the performance of our method, combining the T1-w and FLAIR sequences, was similar to or better than the best evaluated pipeline incorporating lesion segmentation and filling. Differences in tissue volume between images processed with the proposed algorithm and the same images where lesions were filled using expert lesion annotations were lower than $0.15\%$ on all tissues, validating the overall capability of the proposed method reducing the effects of WM lesions on tissue segmentation. 

In general, our results showed that the percentages of error in tissue volume of our approach were low or similar with both databases. The percentages of error were lowest when the FLAIR modality was used, which evidences that this image sequence has a direct effect on the efficiency of the algorithm, and, consequently, it should be used when available. However, the accuracy of the method using only the T1-w modality was also superior to other general purpose strategies, which also evidences that the improvement in tissue segmentation was not only generated by the addition of the FLAIR modality, but also by the combination of intensity, anatomical and morphological priors, and the use of a specific outlier algorithm with integrated lesion filling.
