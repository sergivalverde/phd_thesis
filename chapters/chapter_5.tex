\label{chapter:chapter_5}

In this chapter, we present a detailed evaluation of the performance of different pipelines that incorporate fully automated processes such as lesion segmentation, lesion filling and tissue segmentation on MS data. For each automated pipeline, we analyze the percentage of error in tissue segmentation between a set of 70 MS images, where WM lesions have been refilled before segmentation and the same images processed at different levels of automation from manually masking lesions to fully automated lesion segmentation and filling. This analysis has been published in the following paper:
